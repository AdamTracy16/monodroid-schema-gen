= What is this? =

monodroid-schema-gen is an Android layout.xml schema generator.

WARNING: Android layout xml does not fit well with XML schema restrictions.
XML Schema is not extensible enough to accept non-standard components nor
non-standard attributes which are (still) in android XML namespace (due to
the limitation of element/attribute wildcards). So, you CANNOT use the
resulting schema to VALIDATE your layout xml resources.
It should be used only for auto-complete element/attribute candidates.

It consists of three separate tools.

- type-hierarchy-importer.exe fetches android documentation for
  android.view.View (i.e. View.html), parses the documents for all known
  indirect subclasses of View as well as View itself, and outputs java-based
  type hierarchy definitions.
  It generates type-hierarchy.xml.

- gen-android-r-styleable.exe fetches android documentation for
  android.R.styleable, which is in fact deprecated and does not exist in
  android.jar (thus nor Mono.Android.dll), parses the document for all known
  attributes in android namespace, and outputs the attributes list.
  It generates all-known-attributes.xml.

- monodroid-schema-gen.exe parses Mono.Android.dll and all-known-attributes.xml
  to generate schemas which reside in each namespace.


= Usage =

run below:

	make MONO_ANDROID_DLL=/path/to/Mono.Android.dll

which should take all care.
This takes for a while, as attribute-doc-importer.exe retrieves ALL relevant
HTML documentation webpages from developer.android.com.

It will generate two schema files:

	- android-layout-xml.xsd
	- schemas.android.com.apk.res.android.xsd

That's all. Note that both are required to auto-complete layout.xml nodes.

= External Tool =

It uses SgmlReader: http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SgmlReader.
